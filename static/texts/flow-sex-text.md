#### Measure
Migrant flow data measure the number of persons migrating between an origin and destination country over a given period of time. In the plot above we filter to show only estimated migrant flows above X??? persons during each five-year period.

#### Data
[METHOD]

Full details of the method are presented in [Abel and Cohen (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01271-z), alongside five other methods, whose estimates can also be viewed above using the dropdown menu. [Validation exercises](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01271-z#Sec5), based on comparisons to available migration flow data published by national statistical offices, show that estimates based on the closed demographic accounting framework perform consistently better than estimates from the four other estimation approaches.
