#### Measure
Migrant population data measure the number of persons by their country of birth or citizenship and their country of residence at a specific point in time, where the timing of the arrival of the migrants in their destination country is unknown. In the plot above we filter to show only migrant populations above 5,000 persons. 

#### Data
Values are based on the migrant population data published by the [Population Division](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/) of the United Nations which estimates counts of the foreign-born populations, by country of birth, for 235 countries. Data are primarily based on records from censuses, nationally representative surveys and population registers provided by national statistical institutes to the United Nations. Their records are then adjusted to include refugee statistics not included in the primary data sources and to align to the five-year time points using interpolation and extrapolations outlined in the [methodology](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/international-migrant-stock) documentation. In countries lacking data on place of birth, the United Nations use available information on the country of citizenship as a proxy for the birthplace of international migrants, equating international migrants with foreign citizens in these cases.
