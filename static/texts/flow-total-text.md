#### Measure
Migrant flow data measure the number of persons migrating between an origin and destination country over a given period of time. In the plot above we filter to show only estimated country-to-country migrant flows above X??? persons during each five-year period.

#### Data
Values are based on estimates of migrant flows from one of six different estimation methods. All estimation methods are based on changes in migrant population data published by the [Population Division](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/international-migrant-stock) of the United Nations. Full details of each method are presented in [Abel and Cohen (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0089-3). [Validation exercises](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0089-3#Sec13), based on comparisons to reported migration flow data published by national statistical offices, show that methods based on the closed demographic accounting framework perform consistently better than the four other estimation approaches.
